  1. Current flowing pattern
  2. Cosmic Nebula
  3. Dynamic Mandala
  4. Electric Field
  5. Wave interference with red theme
  6. Kaleidoscope with rainbow theme
  7. Dynamic Geometric Pattern
  8. Quantum Flux
  9. Liquid Crystal
  10. Aurora Dreams
  11. Neon Cityscape
  12. Ocean Depths
  13. Burning Mandelbrot
  14. Julia Spirals
  15. Water Caustics

- Music playback system with:
  - Random track selection
  - Mute/Unmute functionality
  - Skip track option

## Effect Descriptions

- **Quantum Flux**: Hypnotic effect with layered, fractal-inspired patterns and pulsating color gradients
- **Liquid Crystal**: Beautiful fluid-like movement with prismatic colors that simulate liquid crystal displays
- **Aurora Dreams**: Northern lights-inspired effect with organic flowing patterns and starry background
- **Neon Cityscape**: Cyberpunk-inspired city with glowing neon signs, animated rain, and flying vehicles
- **Ocean Depths**: Deep sea bioluminescent effect with light rays and underwater caustic patterns
- **Burning Mandelbrot**: A fiery take on the classic Mandelbrot fractal with warm, dynamic colors
- **Julia Spirals**: Dynamic Julia set with evolving spiral patterns and shifting colors
- **Water Caustics**: Realistic underwater light refraction patterns with shimmer effects

## Technical Details

- Built with vanilla JavaScript and WebGL
- Uses GLSL shaders for visual effects
- Implements a custom music player with track management
- Responsive design that works on any screen size
- User interaction required to start audio (for browser compatibility)
